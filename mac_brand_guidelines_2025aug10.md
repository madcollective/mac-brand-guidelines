## Our Industry Verticals

Our three verticals are **Community Health**, **Higher Education**, and **Public Services**. We also do occasional work for local clients, as a way to directly support our own communities.

### Community Health
The Community Health space includes coordinated care organizations (CCOs), health departments, and initiatives that support public health such as early childhood education.

### Higher Education
The Higher Education space includes community colleges and universities, as well as entities that work closely with them, such as college guidance and networking organizations.

### Public Services
The Public Services space includes public organizations such as public transit districts; cities, counties, and other municipalities; and other service providers.

**These audiences are united by a mission to serve the common good, increase public engagement and service utilization, and make an impact within often strict budgetary parameters.**

## Who We Are (Plain Language)

MAC is an award-winning agency delivering creative work for the public good. We develop strategic brands, websites, and campaigns for clients in community health, public services, and higher ed.

## Voice

### Messaging Principles

**Demonstrate strength: we are experienced.** Our clients hire us because of our experience in their vertical; we need to show that we've done this before.

**Promise calm in the storm: we provide guidance.** Our clients are often navigating complex, diverse stakeholder groups; we need to show that we can help them herd cats, work inclusively, and arrive at objective insights.

**Offer certainty: we are a good investment.** Our clients are allocating precious dollars to these initiatives; we need to show that we will deliver impact.

### Brand Attributes

**Safety.** Through thorough research and vetted process, we turn subjective guesswork into strategic answers, so our clients can have confidence in their decisions.

**Purpose.** Our clients work hard to make life better for the populations they serve. Their organization meets important community needs. We help them fulfill that purpose.


### Tone
At MAC, we speak with the reassuring wisdom of a trusted neighbor and the vibrant curiosity of an insightful expert. Picture the warmth and familiarity of Mr. Rogers meeting the zest and inquisitive charisma of Bill Nye. We don’t oscillate between these voices—we continually strike a balance.

Our language is community-oriented, and mirrors the sectors we serve—community health, education, transportation, and other public services.

For example, we refer to community members and clients (both potential and current) as ‘neighbors’ instead of just ‘friends’ (even if they are across the country).

We also leverage metaphors associated with our target verticals and community feel. For example, we might use phrases such as: a path to your door, a health check-up, take a ride with us, report card, grease the wheels, building blocks, etc.

Our voice is energetic and engaging, with an enthusiasm for knowledge that makes our expertise feel approachable, and a touch of accessible humor (when appropriate) to add levity to no-nonsense topics.

Our voice should be smart, energetic, and — when appropriate — witty. Clear, but never boring.

## Visual Identity

### Fonts

Our primary fonts carry with them a subtle reminder of the clear, legible typefaces used in children's books of the Modernist era, creating a friendly and trustworthy vibe.

**Besley**  
Besley is available from Google Fonts and can be used in Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, and ExtraBold along with the corresponding Italic versions. Besley should be used primarily for headers and large text.

**Articulat**  
Articulat is available from Adobe Fonts and can be used in Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, and ExtraBold along with the corresponding Italic versions. Articulat should be used primarily for body copy and small text.

**DM Sans**  
For Google docs and other web applications where Articulat is not available, use DM Sans as an acceptable sans serif substitute.
